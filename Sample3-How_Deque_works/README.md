# LeanSTL - Sample 3 - How Deque works

Try to figure out how Deque works

This is what the deque looks like, when

* The map size is 5, which means it has 5 chunk of buffers

* Each buffer can contain 6 elements at most, the last buffer has 3 vacancies, which means this deque's size is 21, and its capcity is 24.
